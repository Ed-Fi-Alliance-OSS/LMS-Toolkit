# End-to-End Demonstrations

These notebooks demonstrate how to install and run the extractors and the
Learning Management System Data Store Loader (LMS-DS Loader) in a Jupyter
notebook. The same code can be copied over into a stand-alone Python script
instead of running inside the notebook.

Before running the notebook:

* Be sure that you have Python 3.9+ and Poetry
* Run `poetry install` in this directory

Each notebook has additional "getting started" instructions.

* [Canvas](canvas-e2e.ipynb)
* [Google Classroom](google-e2e.ipynb)
* [Schoology](schoology-e2e.ipynb)
