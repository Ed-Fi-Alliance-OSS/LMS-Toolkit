# End-to-End Demonstrations

These notebooks demonstrate how to install and run the extractors and the
Learning Management System Data Store Loader (LMS-DS Loader) in a Jupyter
notebook. The same code can be copied over into a stand-alone Python script
instead of running inside the notebook. Each notebook has its own
getting-started instructions.
