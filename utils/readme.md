Unlike the `src` directory, the programs in this space are for support of the
development and testing process, rather than intended to be run by downstream
users.

* [LMS File Tester](file-tester/) is a script for validating the directory
  structure, columns, and some formatting details for files created by the
  extractor utilities.
