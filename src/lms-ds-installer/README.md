# LMS-DS-Installer

Scripts for installing the Ed-Fi Learning Management System Data Store (LMS-DS)
sql schema script. For the time being, must run the scripts manually, although
eventually this directory will contain a Python program for running migration
scripts that will bring a database up to date from command line execution. See
(Fizz-88: LMS-DS Installer for SQL
Server)[https://tracker.ed-fi.org/browse/FIZZ-88].
