# notebooks

These notebooks provide examples of how to work with the CSV files that are
generated by the extractor programs.

1. Download the latest code from [the project homepage](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Exchange-OSS/LMS-Toolkit) by clicking on the green "CODE" button and choosing an appropriate option. If choosing the Zip option, extract the file contents using your favorite zip tool.
1. Open a command prompt* and change to this file's directory (* e.g. cmd.exe, PowerShell, bash).
1. Ensure you have [Python 3.9+ and Poetry](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Exchange-OSS/LMS-Toolkit#getting-started).
1. At a command prompt, install all required dependencies:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

1. If you have the Jupyter plugin in Visual Studio Code, then you can open and
   run the notebooks directly in VS Code.
1. Otherwise, start the notebook web server, which will automatically open a web
   page for exploring the notebooks in your default browser:

   ```bash
   poetry run jupyter run
   ```

   For more information on using this command, please see [the Jupyter
   documentation](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html).
