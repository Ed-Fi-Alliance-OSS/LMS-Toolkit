# Canvas LMS Data Extractor Spikes

The purpose of this project is to explore the Canvas LMS APIS
in order to extract data and generate new information with it.

This data extractor targets two audiences.  The first is
someone who just wants the data out of Canvas LMS into a
.csv file that can be loaded into a spreadsheet.  The
second for someone who is familiar with Jupyter Notebook,
a common Python-based tool for analysis and reporting.

## Folder Structure

You can explore the work done by navigating across the subfolders
that you can see inside the current src/canvas folder.
The explorations were driven by spikes and stories that you can see
