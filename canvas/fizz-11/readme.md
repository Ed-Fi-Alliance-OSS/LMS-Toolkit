### Canvas REST API
This script gets the data from the Canvas REST API
[Canvas docs](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/)

### What does it do?
Generates some CSV files with information for a specified year, extracted from Canvas REST API:
* Courses
* Assignments
* Students
* Enrollments
* Submissions

### How to use it
1. Run the command ``yarn install``.
2. Copy the .env.example file to .env and update its values.
3. Run the command ``node index``.
4. The CSV file should be created at the same level as the index.js file.

### .env information
